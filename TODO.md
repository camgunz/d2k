# To Do

## Prototype

1. Ensure singleplayer still works
  - Input is never handled

1. Fix jitter with uncapped framerate

---

## ZDDL

1. Add latency mitigation
  - projectile nudging
    - right now, projectiles are predicted, and they therefore usually appear
      ahead of where they would normally spawn
    - projectile nudging would spawn the projectile normally (i.e., right in
      front of the firing player), and adjust the projectile's velocity based
      on the client's lag and a preselected function
  - player movement smoothing
  - unlagged
    - Save attacking player position
    - Save current game state
    - Restore game state that player was viewing during the attack
      - This is contained in the command
    - Restore attacking player position (if possible)
    - Run hit detection and damage calculation
      - For every impacted actor:
        - Save momx/momy/momz values
    - Restore saved state
    - For every impacted actor:
      - Add new momx/momy/momz values to the current momx/momy/momz

1. Remove 4 player restriction

1. Add spectators

1. Better configuration file and configuration variable system
  - Ties into scripting and console

1. 3D physics

1. SNDCURVE

1. ZDoom physics
  - Including ZDoom SSG spread

1. PWO

1. Improve console
  - Command history
    - Do this yourself
  - Tab-completion
  - Clipboard (cut/copy/paste)
  - Selection
    - Mouse

1. Add HTTP and JSON (cURL and Jansson)
  - Have client download missing WADs
    - the client should do this between frames in case it needs to download a
      huge file (or a file from a slow server); libcurl ought to make this
      pretty easy
  - Create a server description specification in JSON

1. New widgets
  - Framerate
  - Network stats
  - Add a scoreboard

1. Fix sound problems
  - Rocket spawn sounds don't cut off when they explode
  - No server message sound (just use radio/tink?)

1. Fix server command backlog problems
  - It looks like the server doesn't handle big command backlogs well

1. When switching to a different interface (menu, HUD, console, etc.), all
   key presses should be cleared and spurious key releases ignored

1. No message if the server is full; looks like a crash

1. Super-fast doomguy face

## CTF

1. Slopes

1. Flesh out teams

1. Hexen map support

1. Scripted game modes

1. Add more scripting commands
  - `say_team`
  - `team`

## Version 0.9

1. Make Windows compilation possible
  - Need to build a libXDiff DLL in mingw64-builds

1. Remove all vestiges of command sync, it just doesn't make sense anymore

1. Remove software renderer
  - See about implementing Doom lighting and 8-bit color using shaders

1. Setup testing framework
  - Demos
  - Multiplayer command injection

## Version 1.0

1. Settle on types for:
  - Player indices
  - TICs

1. Cleanup #includes

1. Update renderer

1. Update `players`:
  - `players` will become an `obuf_t`
  - `playeringame` becomes `dboolean playeringame(unsigned short playernum)`
  - `MAXPLAYERS` becomes `VANILLA_MAXPLAYERS` for compat
  - Anything defined using `MAXPLAYERS` will be refactored
  - Servers aren't players
    - Use a camera in non-headless mode
    - All playernums should be unsigned shorts
    - Sending a message to the server can use a bool `to_server` instead of the
      `-1` recipient (which is a hack)
  - Player names are hardcoded for DeHackEd; the way this should work is:
    - Keep a private array of the default names ("Green", "Indigo", etc.)
    - After initialization, check if the names have been modified, by a
      DeHackEd patch or anything
    - If so, set each player's name accordingly
    - Of course, this only works for the 1st 4 players; after that, fuck it
      - Maybe assign more colors

1. Refactor the HUD to use cairo

1. Reimplement the HUD entirely in scripting

1. UDMF

1. Cameras

1. ZIP/PK3 resource files
